# MyBookStore
Application Name - 
This app is mainly intended for book-keepers in the bookstore. Right now in the market there is no Generic app available for managing their books inventory. Even though many book-keepers are going with website development it is very costly and moreover it will not be ready from day1. This app helps in Managing book inventory, Adding books, removing books and updating book information, etc. This will be very user friendly, easy to use and understand
